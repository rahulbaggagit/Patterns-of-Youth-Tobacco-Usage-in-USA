# Patterns-of-Youth-Tobacco-Usage-in-USA
This project uses the dataset 'YTS_Data.csv' provided by Centers Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), State Tobacco Activities
Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. YTS (Youth Tobacco Survey) Data is collected from 1999 to 2017 but for this application
we are taking 2000 to 2017 years. The data was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and 
high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, 
minors ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with
pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages. The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples
of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12). The data for the STATE System were extracted from 
Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking 
frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts. We have a large dataset with 33 variables and 
10596 observation.  A new column was added Data_Value_Bin to check the density of youth smokers which has 
4 levels, Level 1 being the least density of Youth smokers and 4 is high density of Youth smokers. We are having 3 tabs in 
this application. Tab 1 will represent the Map with States coloured on the basis of Density of Youth Smokers Tab 2 will 
represent the Descriptive Analytics Tables which has sub tabs like Education level and Smoking Status of Youth Smokers. 
Tab 3 will represent the plots which has sub-tabs like Youth smoking on the basis of Gender,Type of Tobacco used(cessation,cigarette,Smokeless Tobacco) and
last plot is the percentage of smokers who attempted to quit smoking last year and Percentage of smokers who wish to 
quit smoking divided on the basis of Education level
